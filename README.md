# NVIM configuration

Some notes:

- Based on YT video series from MrJakob
- Uses forked versions of some plugins to remove deprecated warnings:
    - dressing.nvim
    - mason-tool-installer.nvim
    - nvim-lspconfig
    - project.nvim

Should be able to drop it with in `stdpath("config")` and launch nvim.

It has various LSP server references so Rust and Go need to be installed.
